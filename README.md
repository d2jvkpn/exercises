##### 2022/2022-05-23_Go_Brain_Teasers_Exercise_Your_Mind_2021
- date: 2022-05-23

- description: This book contains 25 short programs that will challenge your understanding of Go.
Like any big project, the Go developers had to make some design decisions that at times seem
surprising. This book uses those quirks as a teaching opportunity. By understanding the gaps in your
knowledge, you’ll become better at what you do. Some of the teasers are from the author’s experience
shipping bugs to production, and some from others doing the same. Teasers and puzzles are fun, and
learning how to solve them can teach you to avoid programming mistakes and maybe even impress your
colleagues and future employers.

- description: This book is aimed at practicing Go software developers and students who wish to
experience the excitement and see the benefits of data structures and algorithms in action. Because
of its clean and readable syntax, outstanding support for concurrency and generics, and execution
speed, Go was chosen to present the implementations of the data structures and algorithms along with
many applications. It is assumed that the reader has basic familiarity with Go. The numerous code
listings and their explanations will hopefully serve to improve your programming skills using Go.
