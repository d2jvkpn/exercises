##### 2022/Go_Brain_Teasers_Exercise_Your_Mind_2021
- project: https://pragprog.com/titles/d-gobrain/go-brain-teasers/
- description: This book contains 25 short programs that will challenge your understanding of Go. Like any big project, the Go developers had to make some design decisions that at times seem surprising. This book uses those quirks as a teaching opportunity. By understanding the gaps in your knowledge, you’ll become better at what you do. Some of the teasers are from the author’s experience shipping bugs to production, and some from others doing the same. Teasers and puzzles are fun, and learning how to solve them can teach you to avoid programming mistakes and maybe even impress your colleagues and future employers.
