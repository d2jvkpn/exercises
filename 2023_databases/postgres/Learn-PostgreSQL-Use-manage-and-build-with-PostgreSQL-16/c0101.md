ACID is an acronym of properties, used to indicate that the database engine provides
atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability. Atomicity means that a complex
database operation is processed as a single instruction even when it is made up of
different operations. Consistency means that the data within the database is always
kept consistent and that it is not corrupted due to partially performed operations.
Isolation allows the database to handle concurrency in the “right way”—that is,
without having corrupted data from interleaved changes. Lastly, durability means
that the database engine is supposed to protect the data it contains, even in the case
of either software or hardware failures, as much as it can.
