- Distributed services: Docker, Etcd, Vault, CockroachDB, Prometheus and Kubernetes;
- We will design, develop, and deploy a distributed service to explore what Go
can do. We’ll develop and deploy the service in layers: from the bare essentials
of storage handling, to the networking of a client and server, to distributing
server instances, deployment, and testing. I divided this book into four parts
that parallel those layers. (Don’t worry if you aren’t familiar with the technolo-
gies I mention next—I explain them in the relevant chapters.)
