1. Cooperative: These are tasks that yield voluntarily either by explicitly yielding or by calling
a function that suspends the task when it can’t progress further before another operation has
finished (such as making a network call). Most often, these tasks yield to a scheduler of some
sort. Examples of this are tasks generated by async/await in Rust and JavaScript.
2. Non-cooperative: Tasks that don’t necessarily yield voluntarily. In such a system, the scheduler
must be able to pre-empt a running task, meaning that the scheduler can stop the task and
take control over the CPU even though the task would have been able to do work and progress.
Examples of this are OS threads and Goroutines (after GO version 1.14).
